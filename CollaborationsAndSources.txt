We met with Anna multiple times during student hours and once outside of student hours. In these meetings,
we discussed how to print dotted pairs and how to bind primitive functions. We also talked with John
about binding and applying primitive functions and whether primitive functions should be included inside
of the CONS_TYPE case in eval. We did this without either us or him looking at the other's code. Furthermore,
we also talked with Aadi about how to print dotted pairs when the dot is not going to be right before the 
last element in the list, which we were having a problem with. We also discussed how to apply primitive functions
with Aadi and whether or not we should have any checks for the primitive functions inside of eval.
